            <p>
                This website applies Hick's law by only giving the user a few fields to enter.
                Initially it had only two but it has recently grown to four. These fields are
                an important way to get to the exact information that a ticket buyer wants to see.
                It is often in the first few minute that determines whether webpage is successfull.
                To view the site <a href="https://www.alternativeairlines.com">Altairlines.com</a> click on the

            <p>
                I was very engaged when I saw this site through its use of a black background with Neon colors makes the
                webpage really pop. With each scroll they use the same idea to make their images pop. The use of this
                principle is so key because it make a user want to stay and view the site.
                To view the site <a href="https://www.rollingstones.com/">rollingstones.com</a> click on the link.

            <p>
                Boosted shows, especially on the desktop browser website, a great application of the rule of thirds.
                The text for their products was always found in the center square
                The site used a slider library to show four banners that used the same style and formatting.
                This brought a harmonious view and the site felt organized. The mobile view of this site lost some of
                the
                appealing use of the principle, it is still an great example of the rule of thirds.
