    <h2>Virgin Airlines</h2>
    <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
    <img id="virgin-Air-img" src="./images/Capture-virgin-airlines.PNG">
    <p>
       This website applies Hick's law by only giving the user a few fields to enter
       initally it had only two but it has recently grown to four. These fields are the most
       important means to get to the exact information that a ticket buyer must enter to immedaitely 
       get to the information he or she is seeking.

    <h3>Contrast</h3>

    <p>
        I was very engaged when I saw this site through its use of a black background with Neon colors makes the 
        webpage really pop. With each scroll they use the same idea to really make thier images pop.

    <h2>Boosted</h2>
    <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <img id="boosted-img" src="./images/Capture-boosted.PNG">
    
    <p>
            Boosted shows especailly on the desktop browser website a great application of the rule of thirds. The 
            text for thier products was always found right in the middle of the center square and they used a slider
            libaray to show four banners that used the same style and formating. The mobile veiw of this site lost 
            some of the visually impealing use of this principle however was still an example of the rule of thirds.
