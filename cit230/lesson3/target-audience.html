          <h2> Target Audience</h2>
        <p> The focus of this Site would be to provide daily information about the weather to people who like the outdoors. Families and individuals
          who like to be outside and want general information can come to this site to see if their weekend plans will work out.  </p>
          <h3>Scenario #1: </h3>
          <p> Johnny a fisherman in the nearby area takes a look at the weather whenever he is planning his next trip. He pulls up the 
          website in hopes that it will tell him about the next good day he could go, where he can go, and if today is a good day to go.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario #2: </h3>
        <p> The Lopez family wants to go for a hike today but want to make sure that it is not going to rain. Ms. Lopez is looking at our
            site in hopes that she will be able to see if one of the nearby towns in Idaho will be clear or if all will likely be cold. She also doesnt 
            have a whole lot of time or ability to focus since it is real busy. Our site will quickly tell through visual clues and data what it is going 
            to be like.
