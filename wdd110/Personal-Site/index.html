             <p class= "section1-p">  Are there certain people, places, or things that are so meaningful to you that you want something to remind you of them but a 2d is just isn’t cutting it? Whether it be for an anniversary, Christmas, or a birthday; 3d models are a great way to capture a memory. Give models to family and friends as gifts when you really want to celebrate a moment in their lives, like a marriage or graduation. There may also be someone who you don’t want to forget and through this artwork you won’t have to, so get one for yourself! What is great about the models that I create are their elegance and simplicity . They are not blocky; they are very realistic. The size of the model is up to you and you can also decide if you would like to try a different style or have unique poses. Usually I just do a bust but with the technology only your creativity is the limit.</p>

                 <p class="home-paragraph-2">I have designed nearly one hundred models varying from all kinds of people to everyday objects. Maybe you don’t want a person, but you want a monster or a demon for a video game or an animation that is great too! I have used my models for that, and I would be happy to create anything you need. The best aspect of these designs is the ease of alteration, if something is not quite right is takes moments to change the complete form to fit what you want.</p>
